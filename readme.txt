---- How to install ----

1. Open Hammer or Batch Compiler's configuration dialog.
  Set CSG, BSP, VIS, RAD tool pathes to the 'hlcsg.exe', 'hlbsp.exe', 'hlvis.exe', 'hlrad.exe' in 'tools' folder.
  If you are running 64-bit Windows, use the 'hlcsg_x64.exe', 'hlbsp_x64.exe', 'hlvis_x64.exe' and 'hlrad_x64.exe'.
  The main benefit of the 64-bit version is no memory allocation failures, because the 64-bit tools have access to more than 2GB of system memory.

2. Open Hammer's configuration dialog.
  Add 'zhlt.wad' into your wad list.
  Add 'zhlt.fgd' into your fgd list.
